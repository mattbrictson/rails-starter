# These settings that appropriate to the currently running environment are
# accessible through the SECRETS constant, which is a Hash using symbol keys.
#
# For example: SECRETS.fetch(:rails_secret_token)
#
# When deploying to production, symlink a shared/config/secrets.yml file
# containing the production secrets into current/config/secrets.yml, just
# like you would for database.yml.
#
# This system ensures that sensitive tokens, API keys, etc. are kept out
# of source control.
